## ABOUT:
Nmap_ToolK1t is an automated scanner that can be used during a penetration test to enumerate and scan for vulnerabilities. This tool is made for making Nmap scans simpler and automated, depending on user preference.

## Features:
- The purpose of Nmap Toolkit is to provide easy automated scanning from Basic Scanning Techniques, Advanced Scanning Techniques, Firewalls, IDS and Spoofing Techniques to Nikto and Netbios scans using Nmap.
- It helps beginner or Advanced pen-testers to keep everything at pace and simplified.
- Each branched scan has multiple yet specified scans for both IP/website and from a specified file
